# QCalc

## Overview

This project aims to obtain basic skills in Java and OOPs principles by building a subset of features seen in calculators..

During the course of this Micro-Experience, I:

1. Made use of different features of VSCode IDE to build the project.
2. Built feature of a calculator by taking OOPS Principles into consideration.
3. Wrote unit tests to ensure edge cases are handled correctly.
4. Fixed the bugs in the implementation for newly introduced features of the calculator.
